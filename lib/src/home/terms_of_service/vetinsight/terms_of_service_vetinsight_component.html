    <h2>DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES & LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h2>
    <p><span>VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>warrants that VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>has validly entered into these Terms and has the legal power to do so. You warrant that you have validly entered into these Terms and have the legal power to do so.</span> <span>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED ABOVE, THE VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>specifically disclaims all warranties and conditions of any kind, including all implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, freedom from defects, uninterrupted use and all warranties implied from any course of dealing or usage of trade.

Any oral or written advice provided by VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>or its authorized agents does not and will not create any warranty. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHICH MEANS THAT SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</span></p>
    <p><b><span>YOUR USE OF THE VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.</span></b></p>
    <p><span>YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>BE LIABLE (Y) FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER ARISING IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE OR (Z) FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM, DEMAND OR DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>SERVICES.</span></p>
    <p><span>The foregoing disclaimer of liability will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law in the jurisdiction of your place of residence. You acknowledge and agree that the above limitations of liability together with the other provisions in these Terms that limit liability are essential terms and that VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>would not be willing to grant you the rights set forth in these Terms but for your agreement to the above limitations of liability.</span></p>
    <p><span>LEGAL NOTICE FOR NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS: The limitations of liability and exclusion of damages in this section do not apply to New Jersey residents.</span></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
    <p><span>You agree to indemnify and defend VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup><span>, and its Owner, directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all losses, liabilities, actual or pending claims, actions, damages, expenses, costs of defense and reasonable attorneys' fees brought against VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>by any third-party arising from your violation of these Terms, the rights of a third-party or applicable law. VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification hereunder. In any event, no settlement that affects the rights or obligations of VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>may be made without the prior written approval of VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup><span>.</span></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
    <p><span>These Terms are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Oregon, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws of such state, and are binding upon the parties hereto in the United States and worldwide. You and VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms.</span></p>
    <p><b><span>YOU AND VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN THE MANNER SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 10 AND THAT YOU AND VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING SUCH CLAIMS BEFORE ANY COURT OF LAW.</span></b></p>
    <p><b><span>YOU AND VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>FURTHER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.</span></b></p>
    <p><span>Any dispute between you and VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>Parties arising from or relating to these Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms, including Covered Disputes will be settled by binding arbitration in the U.S. State of New York administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its International Arbitration Rules in effect on the date thereof.</span></p>
    <p><span>Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60 days' advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>will provide such notice by mail or e-mail using the contact information on file with VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>and you must provide such notice by mail to VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup>,&nbsp;<address class="inline">Attn: Legal Department, 220 NW 8th Ave, Portland, OR 97209.</address></p>
    <p><span>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If, however, you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive for you. If the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>for all fees associated with the arbitration that VETINSIGHT</span> <span>TM TM </span> <span>paid on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</span></p>
    <p><span>A single arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to which each party hereby waives. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. The arbitrator's decision must be with written explanation and remain confidential.</span></p>
    <p><span>VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>and you agree that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only.</span> <b><span>Neither VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup><span>nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private-attorney action and the arbitrator will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis</span></b> <span>. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this Section 18 is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to these Terms must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred. For purposes of this Section 18, these Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA).</span></p>
    <p><b><span>Please Note:</span></b> <span>By agreeing to these Terms, you explicitly agree that any claims or actions that you may otherwise have against VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>under the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States are hereby waived, including without limitation, any claims or actions under the laws of your own country, and that your sole location and applicable law for any dispute is in the United States according to the terms of this Section 18.</span></p>
    <p><span>LEGAL NOTICE TO NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS: The provisions in this section that (i) limit the period of time within which a claim may be asserted against VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>and (2) exclude certain damages do not apply to New Jersey residents.</span></p>
  </li>

  <li>

VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>may terminate or modify your access to the Sites/Service, with or without notice to you, at any time for any reason. For example, access to the App/service may be denied without notice if VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup> <span>believes that you are not at least age 13.</span></p>
    <p><span>Termination will not limit any of the other rights or remedies of VETINSIGHT</span><sup>TM</sup><span>. This Section 17, along with Sections 9, 14, 15, and 16, survive termination of these Terms.</span></p>
